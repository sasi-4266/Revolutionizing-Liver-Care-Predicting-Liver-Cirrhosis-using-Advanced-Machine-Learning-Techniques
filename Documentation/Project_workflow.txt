ðŸ”¹ Activity 2: System Overview and Predictive Workflow Documentation
Objective:
To document the complete process of designing, developing, and deploying a machine learning model for liver cirrhosis prediction.

Work Done:

Developed a clear end-to-end pipeline covering all major stages:
Data Acquisition â†’ Preprocessing â†’ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training â†’ Evaluation â†’ Deployment

Considered practical deployment aspects, including:

Seamless integration with healthcare systems

Support for real-time prediction

Ensuring data privacy and model interpretability

Topics Covered:

Introduction to the role of ML in healthcare applications

Dataset cleaning and preprocessing techniques

EDA to uncover patterns and correlations

Feature engineering and handling class imbalance

Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting

Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC Curve

Interpretability tools like SHAP values and feature importance plots

Considerations for clinical deployment and system limitations

Outcome:

Created a comprehensive and well-structured documentation that outlines the entire system architecture, predictive workflow, and deployment plan.
