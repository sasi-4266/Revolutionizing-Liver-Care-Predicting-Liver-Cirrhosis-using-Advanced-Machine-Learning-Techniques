ðŸ”¹ Activity 1: Specify the Diabetes Results
Objective:
Explore the influence of diabetic factors on liver cirrhosis and identify relevant features in the dataset that reflect this connection.

Work Done:

Researched clinical studies highlighting the correlation between diabetes and liver damage.

Identified key diabetic indicators such as blood sugar levels, glucose, and insulin resistance, along with their impact on liver health.

Mapped these indicators to relevant columns in the liver dataset to enhance prediction performance.

Outcome:

Confirmed the relevance of diabetes-related features for improving model accuracy.

Demonstrated the multi-system impact of cirrhosis, supporting the need for a comprehensive prediction model.
